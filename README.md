# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
We are utilizing Unsupervised Machine Learning to discover unknown patterns or groups in data. It helps us explore data when we are not sure what we are looking for. We primarily use K-means algorithm that will assist us in grouping similar data into clusters along with principal component analysis (PCA). Accountability Accounting is looking to provide a new cyptocurrency investment portfolios to their customers. They would like to know which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. 

## Results
<b>Elbow Curve</b>

We create an elbow curve to find the best value for K and how many cluster we can divide our cryptocurrencies into. As we can see above, the optimal result would be 4 different clusters.

<b>3D Scatter Plot</b>

This 3D Scatter Plot demonstrates to use the three major groups within the crytocurrencies and one outlier.

<b>HV Scatter Plot</b>

This HV Scatter Plot demonstrates something similar as well, showing us three major groups with a couple outliers.
